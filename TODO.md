# Deep Learning Slides - New Animated Slides Task

## Plan
Create 3 stunning animated slides after `deep-learning-title-slide.html` covering the transcript about the evolution and foundations of Deep Learning.

## Slides to Create

- [ ] **Slide 1:** `deep-learning-slide-00a-road-to-dl.html` — "The Road to Deep Learning"
  - Animated 3-phase evolution timeline: Rule-Based → ML → Deep Learning
  - Spam detection code snippet example
  - Animated flowing arrows between phases
  - Glowing "Key Question" callout at bottom

- [ ] **Slide 2:** `deep-learning-slide-00b-brain-inspired-dl.html` — "The Brain Behind Deep Learning"
  - Animated neural network canvas (pulsing nodes + flowing signal particles)
  - Brain inspiration + baby learning analogy cards
  - How neurons → artificial neural networks

- [ ] **Slide 3:** `deep-learning-slide-00c-why-dl-dominates.html` — "Why Deep Learning Dominates"
  - Representation learning animated layer visualization
  - Animated SVG data scaling graph (Traditional ML vs Deep Learning curves)
  - Key insight callout

## Progress
- [x] Create Slide 1 — `deep-learning-slide-00a-road-to-dl.html`
- [x] Create Slide 2 — `deep-learning-slide-00b-brain-inspired-dl.html`
- [x] Create Slide 3 — `deep-learning-slide-00c-why-dl-dominates.html`
